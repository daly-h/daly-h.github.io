## **Areas of Divergence**

- **Optimism vs. Caution**:  
  - **Ryan** was more optimistic about the inevitability of the energy transition and Ireland’s ability to adapt.  
  - **Daly** was more cautious, emphasizing the entrenched political and systemic barriers that slow progress.

- **Government Commitment**:  
  - **Ryan** believes there is genuine political commitment, though delivery is slow due to complex systems and opposition. 
  - **Daly** was more critical, suggesting that the government hope to avoids penalties, leading to inaction.

- **Legal Clarity**:  
  - **Daly** highlighted the need for clearer mandates for regulatory bodies to ensure alignment with climate goals.  
  - **Ryan** agreed but focused more on the broader need for investment and political will to drive change.

---

## **Conclusion**

Both participants agreed on the seriousness of Ireland's climate challenges and the need for urgent action. The main differences lay in their levels of optimism and their assessment of government commitment. Ryan emphasized the potential for progress and the inevitability of change, while Daly highlighted the significant political and systemic barriers that still need to be addressed.

# **Inside Politics Podcast - Cleaned Transcript (10th March 2025)**

## **Introduction**

**HUGH:** You're listening to the Irish Times. Welcome to the Inside Politics podcast. I'm Hugh Linehan. 

Ireland could face penalties between €8 billion and €26 billion if it fails to meet 2030 European standards, according to a recent report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Climate Change Advisory Council. This would significantly impact the economy and the state's ability to provide essential services.

How likely is this scenario? Why are we falling short, and what can be done to mitigate this risk? Joining me are Professor Hannah Daly of Sustainable Energy at University College Cork, and former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, who recently served as Minister for Climate and the Environment.

## **Discussion**

### **Compliance Costs and Legislation**

**HANNAH:**  
- Three key pieces of legislation aim to help Ireland and the EU reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels:  
  1. **Effort Sharing Regulation (2018)** – Covers emissions from domestic transport, buildings, small industry, and agriculture. If Ireland exceeds its emission limits, it will need to purchase credits from countries that have overachieved.  
  2. **Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation** – Sets national limits on emissions from forestry, soils, and wetlands. Compliance costs could range from €1.6 billion to €5.8 billion, reducing with additional measures.  
  3. **Renewable Energy Directive** – Requires that 43% of Ireland's final energy consumption comes from renewables by 2030. Progress in electricity is notable, but heating and transport sectors lag.

---

### **Uncertainty in Compliance Costs**

**HUGH:** Why is the projected cost range so broad?  

**HANNAH:**  
- The cost of buying credits is uncertain and depends on market conditions.  
- If countries like Portugal and Spain have surplus credits, Ireland can buy from them.  
- However, if overall EU targets are missed, credit scarcity could drive prices up significantly.

---

### **Challenges in Delivery and Political Commitment**

**HUGH:** Eamonn, did you foresee this risk during your time as Minister?  

**EAMONN:**  
- Yes, we've struggled with the speed and scale of necessary changes.  
- The transition to cleaner energy is inevitable due to its security and sustainability benefits.  
- The key challenge is accelerating this transition.  
- The report rightly frames this as an opportunity—investing now will avoid larger costs later.

**HUGH:** But if acceleration is needed, were we moving too slowly over the past five years?  

**EAMONN:**  
- The plans are broadly correct, but delivery has been slow due to:  
  - High costs  
  - Political hesitancy  
  - Resistance to local change  

- Politicians support climate action in principle, but it becomes challenging when it meets local opposition.

---

### **Key Areas of Focus**

**HUGH:** Hannah, the report highlights three key areas: EVs, grid upgrades, and forestry. Why focus on these?  

**HANNAH:**  
- These areas illustrate how investment can reduce compliance costs and bring domestic benefits.  
- **Agriculture** accounts for half of the emissions under the Effort Sharing Regulation, and **transport** for about a quarter.  
- Addressing agriculture is challenging, but necessary. Some sectors, like beef and lamb, are loss-making without subsidies, suggesting potential for emission reductions without significant cost.

---

### **Structural Changes in Agriculture**

**HUGH:** Should livestock numbers be reduced?  

**EAMONN:**  
- Yes, but change is happening. Fertilizer use is already decreasing, improving farm economics and reducing emissions.  
- Transport poses a bigger challenge.  
- Measuring emissions from land use is also complex, especially as climate impacts worsen (e.g., wildfires).

---

### **Influence of Larger EU Countries**

**HUGH:** Could larger EU countries influence target enforcement?  

**EAMONN:**  
- It's risky to assume targets will be relaxed.  
- Europe's economic and security interests align with reducing fossil fuel dependence.  
- Europe will likely uphold its climate commitments.

---

### **Reasons for Lagging Progress**

**HUGH:** Hannah, why is Ireland lagging in meeting targets?  

**HANNAH:**  
- Political reluctance to make tough decisions.  
- Legacy issues in agriculture and infrastructure.  
- A slow and complex planning system.  
- The government appears to hope penalties will be avoided, reducing their sense of urgency.

---

### **Political Resistance and Future Prospects**

**HUGH:** Eamonn, given political resistance and independent influences, is progress realistic?  

**EAMONN:**  
- We'll be monitoring closely.  
- Everyone cares about protecting future generations.  
- Major decisions, like infrastructure investment and transport strategies, will test commitment.

---

### **Challenges with the Legal System**

**HUGH:** Could the legal system be a barrier to action?  

**EAMONN:**  
- The legal system is slow and expensive, delaying projects.  
- Courts must balance individual rights with the common good to avoid delays in climate-related projects.

---

### **Regulatory Clarity**

**HANNAH:**  
- Complexity in regulatory decisions, such as LNG and data centers, creates legal ambiguity.  
- Clearer mandates for bodies like the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities are needed to align with climate goals.

---

### **Government’s Role in Providing Clarity**

**EAMONN:**  
- The government should provide clarity where legal uncertainties persist, especially concerning infrastructure and energy security.

---

### **Can the Political System Deliver?**

**HUGH:** Is the political system capable of delivering these changes?  

**HANNAH:**  
- Progress has been made, but vested interests remain strong.  
- Market forces alone aren't enough—stronger political will is required.

**EAMONN:**  
- Changing the narrative is key.  
- Climate action must be framed as beneficial and essential to society.  
- Delivery matters, and while it's tough, it's necessary for economic and environmental reasons.

---

### **Life After Politics**

**HUGH:** Eamonn, how's life after politics?  

**EAMONN:**  
- I'm still focused on climate, just in different ways.  
- This work is too important to step away from.
