With former Green Party leader and Climate minister Eamon Ryan, I joined the Irish Times Inside Politics podcast to discuss a recent report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Council. I also asked ChatGPT to summarise the discussion, below.

# **Inside Politics Podcast (10th March 2025) - AI-generated summary**

## **Hannah Daly (Professor of Sustainable Energy, University College Cork)**

- **Compliance Costs and Legislation**:  
  - Ireland faces potential fines of €8 to €26 billion if it fails to meet EU climate targets by 2030.  
  - Key legislation includes the Effort Sharing Regulation, Land Use and Forestry Regulation, and the Renewable Energy Directive.

- **Challenges in Agriculture**:  
  - Agriculture is the largest emissions contributor under the Effort Sharing Regulation.  
  - Some sectors, like beef and lamb, are economically unviable without subsidies, suggesting an opportunity for cost-effective emissions reductions.  

- **Policy and Infrastructure Gaps**:  
  - The government lacks urgency in addressing compliance gaps.  
  - There are major infrastructure deficiencies, particularly in renewable energy integration and public transport development.  
  - Complex and slow planning systems impede progress.

- **Legal Uncertainty**:  
  - Stressed the ambiguity in how climate legislation is being interpreted by regulators and the planning system, particularly regarding LNG infrastructure and data centers.There's ambiguity regarding how bodies like the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities interpret their obligations under climate law.  
  - Recent decisions on LNG infrastructure and data centers suggest a reluctance to enforce climate objectives strongly.

- **Political and Institutional Reluctance**:  
  - Daly was critical, suggesting that there is a prevailing hope within the government and civil service that penalties might be avoided, leading to a lack of urgency in action.

## **Eamon Ryan (Former Green Party Leader and Minister for Climate and the Environment)**

- **Urgency for Change**:  
  - The transition to cleaner energy is inevitable and necessary for security and sustainability.  
  - Key challenges are speed, low-cost delivery, and stronger political commitment.

- **Investment Priorities**:  
  - Urged investment in grid infrastructure, public transport, and renewable technologies.  
  - The upcoming government capital spending review is a critical test of political commitment.

- **Legal and Planning Challenges**:  
  - The slow and complex legal system is a major obstacle to progress.  
  - Courts must balance individual rights with the common good to facilitate faster infrastructure development.

- **Optimism About Progress**:  
  - Ryan expressed cautious optimism about Ireland's ability to meet its targets.  
  - Believes the public and political systems can adapt, though vested interests are slowing change.

- **Political Resistance**:  
  - Acknowledged that political reluctance and opposition, particularly around transport infrastructure, have slowed progress.  
  - Stressed the importance of storytelling and framing climate action as beneficial to society.

## **Areas of Divergence**

- **Optimism vs. Caution**:  
  - **Ryan** was more optimistic about the inevitability of the energy transition and Ireland’s ability to adapt.  
  - **Daly** was more cautious, emphasizing the entrenched political and systemic barriers that slow progress.

- **Government Commitment**:  
  - **Ryan** believes there is genuine political commitment, though delivery is slow due to complex systems and opposition. 
  - **Daly** was more critical, suggesting that the government hope to avoids penalties, leading to inaction.

- **Legal Clarity**:  
  - **Daly** highlighted the need for clearer mandates for regulatory bodies to ensure alignment with climate goals.  
  - **Ryan** agreed but focused more on the broader need for investment and political will to drive change.

## **Conclusion**

Both participants agreed on the seriousness of Ireland's climate challenges and the need for urgent action. The main differences lay in their levels of optimism and their assessment of government commitment. Ryan emphasized the potential for progress and the inevitability of change, while Daly highlighted the significant political and systemic barriers that still need to be addressed.
